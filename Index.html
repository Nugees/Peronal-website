      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am always in awe of how <strong>machines</strong> and <strong>computers</strong> are instructed to do things they are assigned to do. From the internet to games, mobile phones to laptops and even the cloud. The
        thought of what seems to be the mystery behind all these gave rise to the motivation and hunger to learn how to code. For someone an affinity towards technology, I lacked the required experience to pursue a carrer in I.T(coupled with not having an educational background in I.T and a work experience in the industry); this however
        did not hinder the learning process.
        I joined Angela Yu's <em><strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete Web Development Bootcamp</a></strong></em> via <em><strong>Udemy</strong></em> which kickstarted the zeal and I have
        never looked back.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This webpage is to showcase the skills learned so far as well as showcase the ability to build a personal website.</p>
